<p>All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the
terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of

provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the
Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with
a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is
not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to
additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such
Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their

<h2>5. Termination<a class="headerlink" href="#termination" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>5.1.</strong> The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if
You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,
then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are
reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and
finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such
Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your
grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if
such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means,
this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this
License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
Your receipt of the notice.</p>
<p><strong>5.2.</strong> If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,
and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly
infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all
Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall
terminate.</p>
<p><strong>5.3.</strong> In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end
user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
termination shall survive termination.</p>

direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other
commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of
the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply
to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party&#8217;s
negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some
jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.</div></blockquote>

<h2>8. Litigation<a class="headerlink" href="#litigation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a
