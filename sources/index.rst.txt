The PoC-Library Documentation
#############################

PoC - "Pile of Cores" provides implementations for often required hardware
functions such as Arithmetic Units, Caches, Clock-Domain-Crossing Circuits,
FIFOs, RAM wrappers, and I/O Controllers. The hardware modules are typically
provided as VHDL or Verilog source code, so it can be easily re-used in a
variety of hardware designs.

All hardware modules use a common set of VHDL packages to share new VHDL types,
sub-programs and constants. Additionally, a set of simulation helper packages
eases the writing of testbenches. Because PoC hosts a huge amount of IP cores,
all cores are grouped into sub-namespaces to build a better hierachy.

Various simulation and synthesis tool chains are supported to interoperate with
PoC. To generalize all supported free and commercial vendor tool chains, PoC is
shipped with a Python based infrastructure to offer a command line based frontend.
